> To win against me, you must beat me three times: in the opening, the middlegame and the endgame. A. Alekhine

Thuban is moving up a gear with the acquisition of a whole new opening book. This also brings diversity to the beginning of the game.

Moreover, we have fixed some problems with, among others, the triple repetition (this time it's the right one).

Thanks to a code optimization work, Thuban now plays at lightning speed with up to 25% gain compared to the previous version.

Play it [here][1].
And share your feelings on our [discord server][2].

Grazie mille
