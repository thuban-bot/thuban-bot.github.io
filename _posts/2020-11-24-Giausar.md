We are excited to introduce you the first beta version of our chess engine, named Thuban Giausar.

This work began in July.
For this first beta version, this engine knows the rules of chess except En passant.

Thuban has:
  - Alpha-beta pruning
  - a very basic Piece-Square Tables for the evaluation
  - a bitboard representation of the board
