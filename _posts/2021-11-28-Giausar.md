> When I don't have blue, I use red. P. Picasso 

To prepare the new version of Thuban, we decided to change the artistic direction.

We first decided to rework the logo, for that we called [ei8htz][1]. Thanks to him ! 
The logo takes many codes from the origin of Thuban that we will detail in a future article.

Also we decided to rework the blue and use a high quality dark theme to achieve a new version of the site much more modern.

Do you like our new look?

Tell us [here][2]!

See you soon.
